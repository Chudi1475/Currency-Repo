# Currency-Repo

We just got home from a fun trip to South America, specifically Colombia, Peru, and Brazil. There's some leftover cash in:

ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡´ Colombian pesos
ğŸ‡µğŸ‡ª Peruvian soles
ğŸ‡§ğŸ‡· Brazilian reais
Create a currency.py program that asks the user for the amount they have in pesos, soles, and reais and calculates the total in USD.

Make sure to Google the current exchange rates
